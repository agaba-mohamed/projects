## Project Overview

This project, named "ftrace," is an implementation of a dynamic function tracer in C, focusing on analyzing executables. The goal is to list various inputs and outputs of a program's functions, including system calls, internal function calls, signals, and calls from shared libraries.

## Project Structure

- **src**: Contains the source code files.

## Building the Project

To build the ftrace binary, run the following commands:

```bash
make
```

## Running ftrace

To trace a command, use the following command:

```bash
./ftrace <command>
```

For example:

```bash
./ftrace ls
```

This will display information about the function calls, system calls, and signals generated by the "ls" command.

## Output Format

The information is displayed in the following way:

1. Entering function main at 0x42ff231
2. Entering function my_putstr at 0x42ff9fd
3. Syscall write (0x1, 0xff3210123, 0x1) = 0x1
4. Leaving function my_putchar
5. Received signal SIGWINCH
6. Leaving function my_putchar
7. Entering function printf at 0x877621fda31

## Command Usage

To display the usage information, run:

```bash
./ftrace --help
```

## Bonus Points

Here is a list of possible bonus points:

- Display the code of called functions when debugging symbols allow (level of verbosity).
- Unmangling function names.
- Explicit decoding of CALL addresses.
- 32-bit (x86) compatibility.
- Compatibility with different material structures (ARM, PowerPC, SPARC, etc.).
- Compatibility with different systems.
- Tracing another program when the program sends a signal.
- Generation of a call-graph.

## Makefile

```make

Happy tracing with ftrace!
