# R-Type Game Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive information about the R-Type codebase, encompassing the architecture, core functionality, server-client communication, map builder, and associated protocols.

### R-Type Architecture

The R-Type game is structured into three main components: **Core**, **Server**, and **Client**. Additionally, there is a **Map Builder** tool.

#### Core

The Core component is responsible for managing entities within the game. Entities are objects with various characteristics, including collision, health, spawning, type, position, rendering, ID, and scripting. Users can create their entities using shared libraries. To create a new entity:

1. **Create a .kyks file:** Specifies the entity's components and characteristics.
2. **Create a script (if needed):** Contains setup and loop functions for entity initialization and continuous behavior.
3. **Modify CMake (if using a script):** Set the entity name in the "add_library" section.

#### Server

The Server component facilitates communication between clients, handling interactions and sending specific data to each client. Key modification areas include the `handleClients` function, which executes whenever a new client connects.

#### Client

The Client component allows users to play and visually experience their actions. The `parseId` function can be modified to handle server inputs.

#### Map Builder

The Map Builder tool creates an SFML window where users can draw game maps. Entities are loaded from ".kyks" files, and users can place entities on the grid. The map can be saved to a text file.

### R-Type Game

The R-Type game is a re-creation of the classic R-Type game in C++, featuring online multiplayer through a multi-threaded server using Asio and UDP protocol. The SFML library is used for the client.

#### Requirements

- CMake
- Conan

#### Dependencies

- sfml/2.6.0
- asio/1.18.0

#### Supported Platforms

- Linux
- Windows

#### Build

- **Linux:** Run `./build.sh` and then `make`.
- **Windows:** Run `./build.bat` and then `make`.

#### Usage Instructions

- `./rtype_server` to run the server.
- `./rtype_client` to run the client.

### TCP Protocol Documentation

This section outlines the custom TCP-like protocol for the R-Type game, covering connection establishment, login procedures, and logout operations.

#### Connection Establishment

- **220 - Connection Successful:** Indicates successful connection establishment.
- **401 - Connection Failed:** Indicates a failed connection attempt.

#### Login

- **USER - User Authentication:** Used for user authentication.
  - **Response:**
    - 230 - Authentication successful

- **GETROOMS - Get List of Rooms:** Retrieves the list of available rooms.
  - **Response:**
    - 240 - Room list retrieved successfully

- **GETROOMPARTICIPANTS - Get Room Participants:** Retrieves the list of participants in a room.
  - **Response:**
    - 250 - Participants list retrieved successfully

- **CREATEROOM - Create a Room:** Creates a new room.
  - **Response:**
    - 260 - Room creation successful
    - 402 - Room creation failed

- **JOIN - Join a Room:** Allows a user to join an existing room.
  - **Response:**
    - 270 - Joining the room was successful

- **START - Start a Room:** Initiates the start of a room.
  - **Response:**
    - 280 - Room started successfully

#### Logout

- **QUIT - Disconnect and Logout:** Disconnects and logs out.
  - **Response:**
    - 221 - Logout successful

- **LEAVE - Leave a Room:** Allows a user to leave a room.
  - **Response:**
    - 271 - Leaving the room was successful

### UDP Protocol Documentation

This section provides information on the custom UDP-based protocol used for sending packages in the R-Type game.

#### Package Structure

Each package consists of:

- **id:** Unique identifier.
- **x, y:** X and Y coordinates.
- **type:** Entity type.

Example:
```
id: 123 x:42 y:64 type:DATA
id: 123 shoot
```

#### Communication Flow

- **Sending a Package (Client):** Follow the specified format.
- **Server Response:** Depends on the server's behavior.

#### Error Handling

The UDP protocol may not provide extensive error handling. Both client and server should handle errors and ensure correct package formatting.

#### Security Considerations

UDP lacks the security features of TCP. Additional measures like encryption or authentication may be necessary.

#### Examples

- **Sending a Package (Client):**
  ```plaintext
  id: 123 x:42 y:64 type:DATA
  id: 123 shoot
  ```

- **Server Response (Sample Acknowledgment):**
  ```plaintext
  Received package: id: 123 x:42 y:64 type:DATA
  Received package: id: 123 shoot
  ```

## Conclusion

This comprehensive documentation provides insights into the R-Type game, including its architecture, components, protocols, and usage instructions. Ensure adherence to the outlined procedures for successful interaction with the game.
